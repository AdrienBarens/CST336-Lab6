Its orbit around the Sun takes 87.97 days, the shortest of all the planets in the Solar System. It is named after the Roman deity Mercury, the messenger of the gods.","","Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's orbit as an inferior planet, and its apparent distance from the Sun as viewed from Earth never exceeds 28°. This proximity to the Sun means the planet can only be seen near the western horizon after sunset or eastern horizon before sunrise, usually in twilight. At this time, it may appear as a bright star-like object, but is often far more difficult to observe than Venus. The planet telescopically displays the complete range of phases, similar to Venus and the Moon, as it moves in its inner orbit relative to Earth, which recurs over its synodic period of approximately 116 days.","",""],"id":17}],[{"start":{"row":7,"column":0},"end":{"row":8,"column":0},"action":"remove","lines":["",""],"id":18}],[{"start":{"row":5,"column":0},"end":{"row":6,"column":0},"action":"remove","lines":["",""],"id":19}],[{"start":{"row":5,"column":0},"end":{"row":5,"column":4},"action":"insert","lines":["    "],"id":20}],[{"start":{"row":6,"column":0},"end":{"row":6,"column":4},"action":"insert","lines":["    "],"id":21}],[{"start":{"row":3,"column":19},"end":{"row":3,"column":31},"action":"remove","lines":["solar_system"],"id":22}],[{"start":{"row":3,"column":19},"end":{"row":3,"column":20},"action":"insert","lines":["m"],"id":23},{"start":{"row":3,"column":20},"end":{"row":3,"column":21},"action":"insert","lines":["e"]},{"start":{"row":3,"column":21},"end":{"row":3,"column":22},"action":"insert","lines":["r"]},{"start":{"row":3,"column":22},"end":{"row":3,"column":23},"action":"insert","lines":["c"]},{"start":{"row":3,"column":23},"end":{"row":3,"column":24},"action":"insert","lines":["u"]},{"start":{"row":3,"column":24},"end":{"row":3,"column":25},"action":"insert","lines":["r"]},{"start":{"row":3,"column":25},"end":{"row":3,"column":26},"action":"insert","lines":["y"]}],[{"start":{"row":3,"column":29},"end":{"row":3,"column":30},"action":"remove","lines":["g"],"id":24},{"start":{"row":3,"column":28},"end":{"row":3,"column":29},"action":"remove","lines":["n"]},{"start":{"row":3,"column":27},"end":{"row":3,"column":28},"action":"remove","lines":["p"]}],[{"start":{"row":3,"column":27},"end":{"row":3,"column":28},"action":"insert","lines":["j"],"id":25},{"start":{"row":3,"column":28},"end":{"row":3,"column":29},"action":"insert","lines":["p"]},{"start":{"row":3,"column":29},"end":{"row":3,"column":30},"action":"insert","lines":["g"]}]]},"ace":{"folds":[],"scrolltop":0,"scrollleft":0,"selection":{"start":{"row":3,"column":30},"end":{"row":3,"column":30},"isBackwards":false},"options":{"guessTabSize":true,"useWrapMode":false,"wrapToView":true},"firstLineState":0},"timestamp":1584310698568,"hash":"be90739bea0abafc4a478000622acf6423539f6d"}
